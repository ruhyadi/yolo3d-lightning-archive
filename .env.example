# this is example of the file that can be used for storing private and user specific environment variables, like keys or system paths
# create a file named .env (by default .env will be excluded from version control)
# the variables declared in .env are loaded in train.py automatically
# hydra allows you to reference variables in .yaml configs with special syntax: ${oc.env:MY_VAR}
